Oh well, music is another one of my passions: anything with a guitar and a good idea behind is awesome !

In no particular order:

- Meshuggah: oBZEN
- Jeff Buckley: grace
- Stevie Ray Vaugh: Live in austin
- Primal Scream: Screamadelica
- Nine Inch Nails: The downward spiral
- Wilco: Yankee Hotel Foxtrot
