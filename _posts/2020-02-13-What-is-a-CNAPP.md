I work with something that is called a CNAPP. Is that a new type of home appliance ? or worse ( maybe better ), a new kind of eletric powered card from a very much exotic location ?

Your questions will be answered now ( and it's not something that exotic either )

A cloud native application protection platform (CNAPP) is a security and compliance solution that helps teams build, deploy, and run secure cloud native applications in todayâ€™s heavily automated, dynamic public cloud environments. CNAPPs also help security teams collaborate more effectively with developers and DevOps. CNAPP comprises a new category of cloud security platform, consolidating CSPM, CIEM, IAM, CWPP, data protection, and other capabilities.
